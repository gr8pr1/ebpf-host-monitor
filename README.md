A host-adapting security monitoring agent that uses eBPF to learn normal system behavior and detect anomalies. The agent operates in two phases: it first establishes per-host baselines through statistical analysis, then monitors for deviations using z-score anomaly detection with context-aware MITRE ATT&CK mapping.

## How It Works

The agent attaches eBPF programs to kernel tracepoints to observe syscalls at the kernel level. Events flow through a structured pipeline:

1. **Kernel**: Tracepoint programs capture syscall metadata (pid, uid, cgroup, process name) and push structured events to a ringbuf.
2. **Enrichment**: The Go agent drains the ringbuf, resolves pids to binaries (with LRU caching), uids to usernames, and cgroup IDs to container names.
3. **MITRE Mapping**: Each enriched event is mapped to MITRE ATT&CK techniques using context-aware resolution (binary path, comm, flags, destination port).
4. **Aggregation**: Events are bucketed into 1-minute windows per dimension (user, process, container, metric type).
5. **Baselining**: A 168-bucket seasonal model (24 hours x 7 days) learns per-dimension means and standard deviations, with EWMA for drift adaptation.
6. **Scoring**: Each window is scored against the baseline with a minimum stddev floor to prevent false positives on constant-value dimensions. New dimensions seen after learning are flagged via cold-start policy.

### Two-Phase Operation

**Phase 1 — Learning** (default: 7 days): The agent collects events and builds per-dimension, per-time-of-day baselines. High-value security events (ptrace, capset, suspicious connections) are still logged during this phase.

**Phase 2 — Monitoring**: Each aggregation window is scored against the learned baseline. Anomalies are emitted to **OpenTelemetry** (when `otel.enabled`) and **journald** (severity, z-score, dimension). MITRE technique IDs are attached to enriched events; **security-event** OTLP spans include `mitre.technique.ids` when trace export is on. **Anomaly** spans carry scoring metrics (z-score, dimension, window) but not per-event MITRE tags. The baseline slowly adapts via EWMA recalibration.

## MITRE ATT&CK Coverage

The agent maps kernel events to MITRE techniques using enrichment context, not just event type. A single event can produce multiple technique attributions.

| Technique | Name | Detection | Context-Aware |
|---|---|---|---|
| T1059.004 | Unix Shell | `execve` + comm=bash/sh/zsh | Binary path match |
| T1059.006 | Python | `execve` + comm=python3 | Binary path match |
| T1053.003 | Cron | `execve` + comm in cron/crond/anacron/atd | Process `comm` match |
| T1036.003 | Rename System Utilities | `execve` + binary basename != comm | Name mismatch detection |
| T1548.003 | Sudo and Sudo Caching | `execve` + sudo flag | BPF flag detection |
| T1548.001 | Setuid and Setgid | `setuid()`/`setgid()`/`capset()` | Direct syscall |
| T1003.008 | /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow | `openat()` on sensitive files | BPF flag detection |
| T1055 | Process Injection | `ptrace()` | Direct syscall |
| T1071.001 | Web Protocols | `connect()` to port 80/443 | Port-based classification |
| T1571 | Non-Standard Port | `connect()` to C2 ports | BPF flag detection |
| T1021.004 | SSH | `connect()` to port 22 | Port-based classification |
| T1021 | Remote Services | `connect()` to RFC1918 ranges | IP range detection |
| T1205 | Traffic Signaling | `bind()` on privileged port (<1024) | Port range check |
| T1046 | Network Service Discovery | `bind()` on unprivileged port | Port range check |
| T1071.004 | DNS | `sendto()` to port 53 | Port filter in BPF |
| T1106 | Native API | `fork()` | Direct syscall |

## What It Monitors

| Dimension | Tracepoints | Baseline Granularity |
|---|---|---|
| **Process Activity** | `sys_enter_execve`, `sched_process_fork`, `sched_process_exit` | per-host, per-user, per-hour |
| **Network** | `sys_enter_connect`, `sys_enter_bind`, `sys_enter_sendto` (DNS) | per-host, per-user, per-hour |
| **Privilege Escalation** | `sys_enter_setuid`, `sys_enter_setgid`, `sys_enter_capset` | per-host, per-user |
| **Sensitive Files** | `sys_enter_openat` (shadow, sudoers, authorized_keys) | per-host, per-hour |
| **Process Injection** | `sys_enter_ptrace` | per-host |
| **Per-User Profiling** | All above, keyed by UID | per-uid, per-hour |
| **Per-Process Profiling** | All above, keyed by comm | per-comm, per-day |
| **Container** | All above, keyed by cgroup ID | per-cgroup, per-hour |

## Prerequisites

- Linux kernel 5.8+ with eBPF support
- Go 1.24+
- clang and llvm
- libbpf development headers (`libbpf-dev` on Debian/Ubuntu, `libbpf-devel` on RHEL/Fedora, `libbpf` on Arch)
- Kernel headers installed

## Quick Start

From the repo root you can use `scripts/quick-start.sh` (installs build deps on Debian/Ubuntu, Arch, or RHEL-family, then builds and optionally installs the systemd unit), or build manually:

```bash
cd host/ebpf-agent

# Build eBPF programs and Go binary (requires clang, libbpf headers, kernel headers)
make all

# Run (requires root; reads ./config.yaml in the current directory)
sudo ./ebpf-agent

# Or install as a systemd service (uses /etc/ebpf-agent/config.yaml)
sudo make install
```

The agent exposes a health endpoint on `http://localhost:9110/metrics` (operational metrics only — not anomaly scores). Anomalies and `ENRICH-FAIL` lines go to **stderr/journald**; when **`otel.enabled: true`**, detection output is also sent via **OTLP** (see `host/ebpf-agent/config.yaml`).

## Configuration

The agent reads `config.yaml` from the working directory (or pass `-config /path/to/config.yaml`). **At least one `tracepoints` entry is required** — copy the full `tracepoints:` list from `host/ebpf-agent/config.yaml` in the repo; the snippet below shows only the adaptive-baseline knobs (add `otel:` when using a collector).

```yaml
server:
  port: 9110
  metrics_path: /metrics

host:
  id: ""  # auto-detected from /etc/machine-id

baseline:
  learning_duration: 168h      # 7 days
  aggregation_window: 1m
  recalibration_interval: 24h
  ewma_alpha: 0.01
  min_stddev: 1.0              # floor to prevent +Inf z-scores
  state_file: /var/lib/ebpf-agent/baseline.db

scoring:
  zscore_threshold: 3.0
  minimum_samples: 60
  cold_start_severity: warning # severity for new dimensions post-learning

dimensions:
  per_user: true
  per_process: true
  per_container: false
  network: true
  filesystem: true
  scheduling: true

# Required: list every tracepoint to attach (see config.yaml in repo for full list)
tracepoints:
  - group: syscalls
    name: sys_enter_execve
    program: trace_exec
  # ... add remaining programs from host/ebpf-agent/config.yaml
```

### Feature Flags

Disable detection modules at compile time:

```bash
make bpf MONITOR_CONNECT=0 MONITOR_PTRACE=0 MONITOR_DNS=0
```

Available flags: `MONITOR_EXEC`, `MONITOR_SUDO`, `MONITOR_PASSWD`, `MONITOR_CONNECT`, `MONITOR_PTRACE`, `MONITOR_OPENAT`, `MONITOR_SETUID`, `MONITOR_FORK`, `MONITOR_EXIT`, `MONITOR_BIND`, `MONITOR_DNS`, `MONITOR_CAPSET`.

## Health Metrics

The `/metrics` endpoint exposes agent operational health, not security detection output.

| Metric | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `ebpf_agent_info` | Gauge | Agent metadata: host, version |
| `ebpf_baseline_phase` | Gauge | 1=learning, 2=monitoring |
| `ebpf_baseline_progress` | Gauge | 0.0-1.0 during learning |
| `ebpf_events_processed_total` | Counter | Total events through the pipeline |
| `ebpf_ringbuf_drops_total` | Counter | Events dropped due to backpressure |
| `ebpf_enrichment_failures_total` | Counter | PID/binary resolution failures |
| `ebpf_otel_export_errors_total` | Counter | OTel provider shutdown failures (incremented on `Shutdown` error) |
| `ebpf_tracepoints_attached` | Gauge | Number of active tracepoints |

## OpenTelemetry

Set **`otel.enabled: true`** and point **`otel.endpoint`** at an OpenTelemetry Collector (**OTLP gRPC only**; default port **4317**). The `otel.protocol` field must be **`grpc`** (or omitted); HTTP/protobuf exporters are not implemented yet. The agent ships **`internal/otelexport`**: anomaly spans, security-relevant spans, and OTLP metric/log providers. See **`examples/otel-collector/otel-collector-config.yaml`**.

The default **`otel.insecure: true`** is for local collectors. For remote endpoints, set **`insecure: false`** and configure TLS/credentials appropriate to your environment.

When OTel is disabled, detection output remains on **journald** / process logs; **`/metrics`** stays health-only.

## Architecture

Additional Mermaid diagrams (system context, pipeline, phases, telemetry): see **[diagram.md](diagram.md)** in the repo root.

Data flows from kernel tracepoints through a ringbuf into userspace enrichment, MITRE tagging, time-window aggregation, and seasonal baselining. In the monitoring phase, anomalies are **logged** and optionally exported via **OTLP**; `/metrics` exposes **agent health only** (not z-scores as Prometheus series).

## Development

```bash
cd host/ebpf-agent

# Build just the BPF object
make bpf

# Build just the Go binary
make build

# Run tests
make test

# Inspect eBPF maps at runtime (map names depend on your BPF build)
sudo bpftool map list
```

### Prometheus

The agent does **not** export per-event counters or anomaly gauges to Prometheus — only **health** metrics (phase, progress, events processed, ringbuf drops, enrichment failures, OTel export errors, tracepoints attached). Use `examples/prometheus/scrape.yml` and `examples/prometheus/alerts.yml` for availability alerting. For detection output, use **OpenTelemetry** (`otel.enabled`) and/or **journald** logs.

## What This Doesn't Detect

- **Packet payload inspection** — sees destination port/IP but not data content
- **Fileless malware** — `memfd_create` + `execveat` bypasses the `execve` tracepoint
- **Cross-host correlation** — each agent is independent (planned: OTel-based fleet correlation)
- **Kernel rootkits** — malicious kernel modules can hide events from eBPF
- **DNS tunneling** — counts DNS queries but does not inspect query content
- **LD_PRELOAD injection** — shared library hijacking does not trigger `ptrace()` or `execve()`

## Security Considerations

- Requires root privileges for tracepoint attachment
- Baseline state file (`/var/lib/ebpf-agent/baseline.db`) must be root-owned (0600) to prevent baseline poisoning
- EWMA drift adaptation means an attacker slowly escalating over weeks could shift the baseline — set absolute ceiling thresholds alongside relative z-score detection
- During the learning phase, high-value security events (ptrace, capset, suspicious connections) are still logged
- Enricher PID resolution can fail for short-lived processes (TOCTOU) — failures are explicitly logged with `ENRICH-FAIL`
- Enable TLS and basic auth on the health endpoint in production
